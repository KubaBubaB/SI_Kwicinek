# Connect 4

This project is an implementation of the Connect 4 game with a simple GUI and several artificial intelligence algorithms, including:
<ul>
  <li>MinMax with AlphaBeta pruning</li>
  <li>Monte Carlo Tree Search</li>
  <li>Static Heuristic</li>
  <li>Neural Network trained with enforced learning</li>
 </ul>
 
The GUI provides the option to choose whether we want the agents to play against each other or if we want to play against them. It also allows us to adjust parameters such as the depth of search or the number of iterations, as well as track the time taken by each agent to make a move.

The contributions from all of us were equal.
